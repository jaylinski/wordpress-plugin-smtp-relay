SMTP Relay lets you configure a SMTP relay for outgoing emails.

== Description ==

Enter a host, port, from name and from address and send emails via a SMTP relay without having to use the native
PHP `mail()` function.

This is especially useful if the `mail()` function is not configured on your system but a SMTP relay is available.

This plugin only works with unauthenticated SMTP relays!

== Installation ==

Upload the SMTP Relay plugin to your blog, activate it, then configure it.
